Boss is a service provided by Yahoo that provides an API for building your own Search service for use in a website.

more information on: http://developer.yahoo.com/search/boss/

This is a C# implementation of the search. 

It pulls the configuration of the site from the Web.config file.

The following keys need to be added to the configuration.appSettings section: 

<add key="BossApiKey" value="YourAPIKeyFromYahoo" />
<add key="BossSiteSearch" value="www.mysite.com" /><!--do not include http:// -->
<!-- optional, uncomment if a proxy is needed  -->
<!-- <add key="BossWebProxy" value="http://192.168.1.8:8080"/> -->

Have fun.
